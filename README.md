# Synopsis
This is an effort to have an automated way of downloading, installing and configuring various open source databases like:
  Postgresql
  Mysql etc

## Getting Started
  Once you have the repo cloned, you could do the following to get yourself a working vm with an open source database installed.
  An example of how to initiate it:
    In the folder where the repository is downloaded
    ./server.sh build postgresql

### Prerequisities
  You will need Oracle Virtualbox, Ansible, preferably the latest version installed.
  All the development and testing is done on a Macbook, so I assume it will all work on any Linux OS as well.

## Built With

* Vagrant
* Ansible
* Mid night oil
